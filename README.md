# RavineSolo
A small digital reimagination of the party game Ravine. 
This is a card game that I own. I thought that it would be a fun idea to create a digital version, just to see if I could do it. The game is basically being at the mercy of the 
RNG, but I think that it does feel a little like the game. Over all the game is not balanced at the moment, but well see how much work I put into that after it is up and running.
